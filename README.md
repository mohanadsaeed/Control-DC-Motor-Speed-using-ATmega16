# Control DC Motor Speed using ATmega16
 Control the motor speed through potentiometer. The potentiometer is connected through ADC driver and the motor speed is controlled through PWM signal.  
 Also activate INT1 with raising edge to revert the motor direction.

 In the project I implemented the following drivers;
  - LCD
  - ADC
  - DC Motor
  - Timer 0 PWM mode
  - External Interrupt)
